# Simple Airplane Reservation System

## Problem Requirement
- Design a software system that assigns seats on an airplane. Assume the airplane has 20 seats in first class 
(5 rows of 4 seats each seprated by an aisle) and 190 seats in economy class (30 rows of 6 seats each, separated by an aisle). The
software takes three commands: add passenger, show seating, and quit. When passengers are added, ask for the class (first or economy).
the number of passengers traveling together ( 1 or 2 in the first class, 1 or 3 in economy), and the seating preference (aisle or window
in the first class; aisle, center, or window in economy). Then try to find a match and assign the seats. If no match exists, print a message.
